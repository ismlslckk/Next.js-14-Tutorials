#Server Components 
  * In next js , all components are server components
  * server components don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions to create a client

#Client Components 
  * To create a client component it is necessary to add "use client" at the top of the component file
  * Unlike server components client components can't perform tasks like reading files but they have the ability to use Hooks and manage interactions

#Routing
 * Next js has a file system based routing mechanism where the URL
 * The URL paths accessible in the browser are defined by files and folders within your code base

#Routing Conventions
 * All routes must be placed inside the app folder 
 * Every file that represents a route should be named page.js or page.tsx
 * Every folder corresponds to a part segment in the browser URL

#Nested Routes
 * routes follow nested routes with the same convention through folder name

#Dynamic Routes
 * products / [productId] / page.tsx : localhost:3000/6 , we can catch productId from the searchParams in page.tsx

#Nested Dynamic Routes
 * products / [productId] / reviewws / [reviewId] / page.tsx : localhost:3000/6/ , 
   we can catch productId and reviewId from the searchParams in review page.tsx

#Catch all Segments
 * docs/[...slug]/page.tsx : this will match page.tsx for below urls;
     - localhost:3000/docs/feature1
     - localhost:3000/docs/feature1/example1
     - localhost:3000/docs/feature1/example1/detail1
     - localhost:3000/docs/feature1/example1/detail1/.............

 * slug:string[] will pass into searchParams from next.js
