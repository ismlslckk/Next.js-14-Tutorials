#Server Components 
  * In next js , all components are server components
  * server components don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions to create a client

#Client Components 
  * To create a client component it is necessary to add "use client" at the top of the component file
  * Unlike server components client components can't perform tasks like reading files but they have the ability to use Hooks and manage interactions
